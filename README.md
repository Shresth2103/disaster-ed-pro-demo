# Disaster Management Education Platform

Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and fires strike without warning, and schools and colleges in India are often unprepared to respond effectively. While emergency guidelines exist on paper, they rarely translate into structured disaster management education within the curriculum. Manual drills, when they happen, are infrequent, poorly coordinated, and fail to build real preparedness among students and staff.

This project aims to bridge that gap by creating a **digital platform for disaster awareness and preparedness training**. Through interactive simulations, virtual drills, and localized disaster education, the platform equips institutions with tools to train students and staff in a safe, engaging, and repeatable way. The goal is not just to prepare campuses for emergencies, but to cultivate a generation that is more resilient and capable of responding calmly and effectively when disaster strikes.
